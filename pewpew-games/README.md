# PewPew Game Library

<p align='center'><i>This repository will store all the games that will make my PewPew game library, the device will be able to switch through multiple games to play your retro classics on the go!</i></p>

```run.bat``` **(Windows)** essentially is a quick workaround to send the ```.py``` files and update the PewPew device to keep this repository and the device separate.

**Quick Note (Windows users):** To use ```run.bat ```, you MUST change the drive letter to the correct letter—the one referencing the PewPew v10.2—otherwise any ```.py``` files in the incorrect drive will get deleted!
